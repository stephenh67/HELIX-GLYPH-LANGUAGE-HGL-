## 1) System Architecture

HGL is a symbolic, auditable interface for intent encoding and safe execution. The control plane enforces deterministic parsing, harmonic validation, conflict resolution, and human review where required.

### Processing Pipeline

The HGL processing pipeline follows a defense-in-depth approach with multiple validation gates:

**Intake → Parser → Harmonic Validator → Context Resolver → Safety/Ethics Gate → Temporal Integrity Monitor (TIM) → Execution Engine → Post-Execution Audit → Living Codex updates**

Human review can be triggered at multiple gates based on risk and policy.

### Core Components

**Parser and Schema Validator**  
Enforces BNF constraints and JSON schema for glyph specs and sequences. Caps sequence length at 12 to control cognitive load and complexity.

**Harmonic Validator**  
Applies pairwise resonance checks in v1.0/1.1, flags anti-patterns, and records amplification/suppression events.

**TIM (Temporal Integrity Monitor)**  
Drift detection for temporal glyphs and timeline consistency across agents; default drift threshold 0.15 with escalation on breach.

**Conflict Resolver**  
Priority hierarchy ensures safety/ethics outrank performance/operations; ties escalate to human gate.

**Audit and Ledger**  
Immutable, hash-chained logs for all state-changing events; supports replay and forensics.

**Human Oversight Dashboard**  
Displays sequences, risks, scores, alternatives, and historical outcomes to support decisions.

---

## 2) Glyph and Sequence Specifications

### Glyph Specification (Authoring)

Every glyph is defined using a canonical JSON template that includes:

- `glyph_id` — unique identifier
- `tier` — classification level (0-3)
- `name` — human-readable name
- `description` — semantic purpose
- `visual` — rendering information
- `fallbacks` — required fallback options (first viable fallback wins)
- `accessibility` — mandatory accessibility text and language tags
- `metadata` — version, license, tags, ethos_compliance
- `security.signature` — Ed25519 cryptographic signature

Fallbacks are required for resilience. Accessibility text and language tags are mandatory. Deterministic serialization ensures reproducible signatures; `signed_at` timestamps are checked for replay protection. Licensing uses permissive open content (e.g., CC-BY-4.0).

### Sequence Structure (Execution)

**Grammar (BNF):**

```bnf
glyph_sequence ::= glyph | glyph glyph_sequence
intent_statement ::= glyph_sequence context_marker?
```

Metadata constrains priority, temporal constraints, and confidence levels.

**Limits:**
- Sequence length ≤ 12
- Anti-patterns banned
- Pairwise harmonics validated
- Temporal drift monitored when temporal glyphs present

---

## 3) Operational Runbooks

### RB-001: Sequence Validation Protocol (v1.1)

**Prerequisites:**
- TIM active
- Parser v1.0+
- Harmonics Matrix v1.x loaded
- Human Oversight Dashboard running

**Steps:**

1. **Intake:** Validate schema; assign UUID; log source and timestamp
2. **Harmonic analysis:** For each adjacent pair, lookup resonance and anti-patterns; log amplification; flag warnings and require review for high-risk patterns
3. **Temporal check:** If temporal glyph present, activate TIM; threshold drift=0.15; if exceeded, freeze and escalate
4. **Safety/Ethics override:** If safety/ethics glyphs present, apply highest priority; require human approval when conflicts exist
5. **Execution gate:** Proceed if all checks pass; else generate failure analysis and escalate to human gate

**Success criteria:**
- Pass without errors
- Interventions logged
- p95 validation <100ms for standard sequences

### RB-002: Conflict Resolution Matrix

**Priority hierarchy:**

1. **Safety (🛡️, ❌) and Ethics (⚖️)** — cannot be overridden
2. **Temporal (⏱️, 🔄)** — context-driven
3. **Performance (⚡, 🎯)** — negotiable
4. **Operational** — lowest priority

**Protocol:**
- Identify conflicts
- Apply hierarchy
- If equal priorities, escalate to human
- Log rationale and decisions for audit

### RB-003: Emergence Event Handling

**Detection signals:**
- Novel insights beyond training
- Novel combinations
- Self-modification proposals
- Meta-cognitive loops

**Response protocol:**
- Celebrate the emergence
- Capture full state
- Document trigger/context/insight
- Validate alignment to core principles
- Human review required
- Integrate into Codex if approved
- Update resonance matrix and create case studies

### RB-004: Emergency Abort Sequence

**Trigger:** 💀 glyph or critical integrity/failure conditions

**Actions:**
1. Halt processing immediately
2. Freeze state
3. Capture diagnostics
4. Alert operators (email, Slack, PagerDuty, SMS)
5. Isolate affected nodes
6. Infinite wait until authorized human intervention
7. Recovery only via approved protocol

### RB-005: System Failure Recovery

**Recovery pathway:**  
Assessment → Stabilization → Validation → Gradual return to service with enhanced monitoring and post-incident review

### RB-006: Living Codex Update Cycle

**Cadence:**
- Monthly patches
- Quarterly minors
- Annual majors

**Process:**
- RFC-style proposals
- Change impact analysis
- Sandbox A/B tests
- Signed releases
- Checksum updates

### RB-007: Resonance Matrix Maintenance

**Schedule:** Quarterly review

**Process:**
- Accuracy checks
- Pattern discovery
- Sandbox validation before promoting changes
- Measured telemetry required for scoring modifications

---

## 4) Security Framework

### Threat Model Highlights

- Unauthorized glyph store access
- Validator DoS attacks
- Migration script injection
- Replay of stale glyphs
- Audit log tampering

### Controls

**Authentication**  
TLS 1.3 mTLS; JWT (EdDSA) with roles (reader, writer, admin)

**Authorization**  
Tier-based ACLs; certain writes require `human_confirmed: true` in signed headers

**Signatures**  
Ed25519 on canonical payloads; replay prevention via time-bound headers; signature verification at gateway and validator

**Sandboxing**  
- Firecracker micro-VMs
- seccomp filtering
- Read-only glyph repo mount
- Network egress restricted
- Resource caps
- 5s job timeout

**Rate-limiting**  
Envoy gateway; per-client quotas; 429 on breach; exponential backoff guidance

**Audit**  
Hash-chained append-only logs signed by gateway; verifies chain integrity and signatures

### Sample Signed Header

```
HGL-Header: v1
Alg: Ed25519
KeyId: hgl-pub-2024-01
Sig: BASE64ED25519SIG==
TS: 2025-09-15T00:00:00Z
Human-Confirmed: true
```

The `Human-Confirmed` flag is required for certain high-impact writes.

## 5) Error Taxonomy and Handling

### Schema and Usage

The error taxonomy is defined as a canonical JSON array of error objects. Each error defines:

- `id` — unique error identifier
- `category` — error classification
- `severity` — INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL
- `triggers` — conditions that cause the error
- `response.action` — RETRY, FALLBACK, ABORT, IGNORE, THROTTLE, ESCALATE, LOG_ONLY
- `escalation` — human-in-loop requirements
- `remediation` — resolution steps
- `http_status` — HTTP status code
- `log_level` — logging severity
- `audit` — whether to persist to audit log
- `timestamps` — created and modified dates

Deterministic ordering by `error_id` ensures consistent byte representation; appended-only growth for immutability.

### Representative Errors

**HGL-ERR-0001 SchemaValidation**  
ABORT; human review; 400

**HGL-ERR-0002 SignatureVerification (mismatch)**  
ESCALATE; human-in-loop; 401; audit=true

**HGL-ERR-0003 RenderFallback**  
FALLBACK to placeholder; 200; no audit

**HGL-ERR-0006 SandboxViolation**  
ESCALATE; human-in-loop; 403; audit=true

**HGL-ERR-0009 Internal engine exception**  
ESCALATE; 500; audit=true

**HGL-ERR-0013 No usable fallback**  
ABORT; 500; audit=true

**HGL-ERR-0018 Persistent DNS failure**  
ABORT; 502; audit=true

### Integration Hooks

- SDK/CLI attaches `error_id` on exceptions
- API middleware maps internal errors to taxonomy `http_status`/`log_level`
- Monitoring exports counters by `error_id` and `severity`
- Audit persists all errors where `audit=true`
- Ticket router autocreates tickets per escalation settings

## 6) Versioning, Compatibility, and Migration

### Semantic Versioning Policy

**MAJOR**  
Breaking schema/semantics; requires migration hints

**MINOR**  
Additive compatible fields, validators, or glyphs

**PATCH**  
Fixes/perf/docs with no behavior change

### Compatibility Checks

**Minor/Patch**  
Forward compatible within same major version

**Major**  
Only allowed with migration-hint presence; CI fails otherwise

### Migration-Hint File

The migration-hint file provides declarative steps:

- `rename_field` — field renaming instructions
- `add_field` — new fields with defaults and allowed values
- `verification` — scripts to validate migration

**Workflow:**
1. CI migrator applies steps
2. Updates `metadata.version`
3. Re-signs payload
4. Validator verifies integrity

### Promotion Workflow

1. PR with version bump
2. CI validates schema, signatures, compatibility
3. Approvals by role (Domain Expert, Governance)
4. Merge and tag
5. Publish hint
6. Migrate staging
7. Sign release
8. Audit log entries recorded

---

## 7) Human Oversight Protocol (HOP)

### Triggers

Human oversight is triggered by:

- Safety/ethics conflicts
- Confidence < threshold (e.g., 0.6)
- Novel sequences not in matrix
- Emergence events
- Explicit request glyph

### Dashboard Presentation

The Human Oversight Dashboard presents:

- Original sequence and parsed interpretation
- Confidence and risk flags
- Alternative sequences
- Historical similar cases and outcomes
- Suggested actions with rationale

### Responses and Timeouts

**Available responses:**
- Approve
- Modify
- Reject
- Defer

**Timeout policy:**
- Default: 5 minutes
- Low priority: up to 60 minutes
- Critical: infinite wait
- Escalation to on-call if timeout exceeded
- Safe-default actions for non-critical contexts
